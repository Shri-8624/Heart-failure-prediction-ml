# Data Science Project - Heart Failure Prediction
In this project, we will predict the risk of heart failure using machine learning algorithms. This is a binary classification problem where we predict whether a person will survive or die due to heart failure.

## Getting Started
To run this project on your machine, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install it using the following command:

**`pip install jupyter`**

You also need to install the required packages and libraries that we will be using in this project. You can install them using the following command:

**`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`**

## Dataset
We will be using the Heart Failure Prediction dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains various features such as age, sex, blood pressure, and serum creatinine level of patients. You can download the dataset from this link: [**Heart Failure Prediction Dataset**.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data).

## Project Structure
This project is divided into the following parts:

1. Data Analysis and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Building and Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Visualization

## Data Analysis and Exploration
In this part, we will explore our dataset using various exploratory data analysis techniques. We will visualize the data using different plots and graphs to understand the correlation between different features.

## Data Preprocessing
After analyzing the dataset, we will preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms. We will perform various operations such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Model Building and Training
We will split our preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets and then build different classification models. We will use scikit-learn library to train the models and evaluate their performance.

## Model Evaluation
After training the models, we will evaluate their performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We will compare the performance of different models and choose the best one.

## Visualization
Finally, we will visualize the performance of different models using a bar chart. We will compare the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of different models.

## Conclusion
In this project, we have shown how to build an end-to-end data science project for heart failure prediction. We have analyzed the dataset, preprocessed the data, trained different classification models, evaluated their performance, and visualized the results.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank Kaggle for providing the Heart Failure Prediction dataset.
